# Blog Site Project Plan

## Current Status Analysis

### ✅ What's Already Implemented
1. **Backend Infrastructure**
   - Express.js backend with GitHub integration
   - Blog post fetching from `mcradcliffe2490/blog-posts` repo
   - Routes for individual posts and post listings
   - Markdown parsing with frontmatter support

2. **Frontend Foundation**
   - Vue 3 + TypeScript setup
   - Vue Router configuration
   - Basic responsive design system

3. **Completed Pages/Features**
   - **Homepage**: Simple "This is a blog" message (matches Mockup 1)
   - **Post List Page**: Functional list with hover summaries (matches Mockups 3 & 4)
   - **Post Detail Page**: Full post reading with back navigation
   - **Navigation**: Header with "Mycale C. Radcliffe" branding

### 🎨 Figma Mockups Analysis
1. **Mockup 1**: Homepage - "This is a blog" with clean navigation
2. **Mockup 2**: About Me page - Personal bio with avatar, contact info
3. **Mockup 3**: Post List - Clean post cards in vertical layout
4. **Mockup 4**: Post List with Summary - Hover state showing summary panel

## 🚀 Remaining Work Items

### High Priority - Core Pages
1. **About Me Page** (Missing - has route but no view)
   - Personal bio section with avatar
   - Contact information (email, Instagram, Discord)
   - Responsive layout matching mockup

2. **Topics Page** (Missing - no route or view)
   - Category-based post filtering
   - Backend routes partially stubbed (`/philosophy`, `/teaching`, `/religion`)
   - Topic navigation with subcategories

3. **Reading List Page** (Missing - linked in header)
   - Personal book recommendations
   - Possibly integrate with Goodreads or manual curation

### Medium Priority - Feature Enhancements
4. **Random Post Feature**
   - Backend route exists but unimplemented
   - Frontend integration needed

5. **Topic Filtering System**
   - Complete backend implementation for topic routes
   - Frontend filtering UI
   - Post categorization system

6. **Search Functionality**
   - Full-text search across posts
   - Search results page
   - Search input in header

### Low Priority - Polish & Optimization
7. **Mobile Responsiveness**
   - Current design has basic responsive styles
   - Test and refine across devices
   - Touch-friendly interactions

8. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Image optimization
   - Code splitting
   - Caching strategies

9. **SEO & Meta Tags**
   - Dynamic meta descriptions
   - Open Graph tags
   - Sitemap generation

## 🔧 Technical Debt & Improvements

### Code Quality
- Convert remaining components to `<script setup>` syntax for consistency
- Add proper TypeScript interfaces for all API responses
- Implement error boundaries and better error handling
- Add loading states for all async operations

### Backend Enhancements
- Implement caching for GitHub API calls
- Add pagination for large post lists
- Implement post search indexing
- Add rate limiting and error handling

### Testing
- Unit tests for components
- Integration tests for API routes
- E2E tests for critical user flows

## 📋 Implementation Priority Order

### Phase 1: Core Missing Pages (1-2 weeks)
1. About Me page implementation
2. Topics page basic structure
3. Reading List page

### Phase 2: Feature Completion (1-2 weeks)
1. Complete topic filtering backend
2. Random post functionality
3. Search implementation

### Phase 3: Polish & Optimization (1 week)
1. Mobile responsiveness testing
2. Performance optimizations
3. SEO implementation

## 🎯 Success Criteria
- All navigation links functional
- Responsive design across devices
- Fast page load times (<2s)
- Intuitive user experience matching mockups
- Clean, maintainable codebase
